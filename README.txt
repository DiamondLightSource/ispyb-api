This API is meant to be used server side only as it connects directly to the database. 
The database user has privileges to connect to the database and execute certain 
packages with stored procedures and functions.

Requirements:

- The cx_Oracle Python package. (This is provided by all recent SciSoft Python installations.)

The pipeline2ispyb.py file is provided as an example of how to use the API.
