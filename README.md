# ISPyB API 

This API is meant to be used server-side only as it connects directly to the database. 
The database user has privileges to connect to the database and execute certain 
stored procedures and functions.

### Requirements
* Recent version of Python 2.x (2.7?)
* The mysql.connector Python package. (The old API version is still using MySQLdb) 
* An ISPyB database on either MariaDB or MySQL

The pipeline2ispyb.py file is provided as an example of how to use the API.
